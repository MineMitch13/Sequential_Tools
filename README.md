Ever found that the early stage vanilla tools are useless at some point? Well, now they won't be anymore! Now you will need all the previous tiers of tools, weapons and armor in order to be able to upgrade to the desired tier!

With inspiration from the [Linear Tools](https://modrinth.com/datapack/linear-tools) datapack!

# Why this datapack?
The reason why I wrote this datapack is because when I was playing with Linear Tools I was unable to craft my stone tools with blackstone and cobbled deepslate for example.

Got any ideas or suggestions on what I could do with this project, let me know on discord.
